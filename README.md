Submitted by: **William Zheng**

This web app: **Team building site based around the game valorant. This app allows you to type the IGN, choose, your agent, and select loadout. This features a summary page as well as any-time editing.**

Time spent: **22** hours spent in total

- [x] **The web app includes a summary page of all the user’s added crewmates**
  -  The web app contains a summary page dedicated to displaying all the crewmates the user has made so far
  -  The summary page is sorted by creation date such that the most recently created crewmates appear at the top
- [x] **A previously created crewmate can be updated from the list of crewmates in the summary page**
  - Each crewmate has an edit button that will take users to an update form for the relevant crewmate
  - Users can see the current attributes of their crewmate on the update form
  - After editing the crewmate's attribute values using the form, the user can immediately see those changes reflected in the update form and on the summary page 
- [x] **A previously created crewmate can be deleted from the crewmate list**

  - After deleting a crewmate, the crewmate should no longer be visible in the summary page
  - [x] **Each crewmate has a direct, unique URL link to an info page about them**
    - Clicking on a crewmate in the summary page navigates to a detail page for that crewmate
    - The detail page contains extra information about the crewmate not included in the summary page
    - Users can navigate to the edit form from the detail page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] A crewmate can be given a category upon creation which restricts their attribute value options
  - e.g., a Dungeons and Dragons class or a development team role (project manager, product owner, etc.)
  - User can choose a `category` option to describe their crewmate before any attributes are specified
  - Based on the category value, users are allowed to access only a subset of the possible attributes
- [ ] A section of the summary page, displays summary statistics about a user’s crew on their crew page
  - e.g., the percent of members with a certain attribute 
- [ ] The summary page displays a custom “success” metric about a user’s crew which changes the look of the crewmate list
  - e.g., a pirate crew’s predicted success at commandeering a new galley


The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Css to make it look better and console logs for debugging

## Notes

This website was definitely the most challenging project so far, but it was well worth the effort. I’d been meaning to learn Supabase for a while, and finally got the chance here. The trickiest part was making sure everything matched up in the database to avoid errors. Supabase turned out to be much easier to use than MySQL, which was a nice surprise. Aside from needing some help with styling, everything else felt familiar from previous projects—just harder.
